# Conclusion

I have lived in Multiple states, I will alway miss Colorado during the winter time. I am currently living in the south on the beach. However there is nothing that compares to hitting the ski slopes and having a week or 2 of nice winter weather and a white Christmas

I will always love ![Colorado](https://freeskier.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Photo1.png)
