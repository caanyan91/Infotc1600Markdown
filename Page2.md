## My first Colorado mountain

My first Mountain I attended was ***Winter Park***. This is a small town during the off season, approximately 1000 at the 2020 census. Instead of me going into detail I have attached a wikipedia link that gives a brief 
summary. Check out *[Winter Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Park,_Colorado)*.
